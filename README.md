This layout offers the choice between the original plastic film or tactile switches. <br>
I’ve opted for the plastic film; however, if it fails in the future, you can easily solder in switches as an alternative.

To install, simply replace the old flex cable with regular wires. <br>
The pin header (pin spacing) on the keypad matches that of the MCU board.

## Error Codes

- **E2** = NTC temperature sensor
- **E5** = Temperature (hot air), only applies to convection oven models
- **E6** = Temperature microwave
- **E14** = Air flap does not open in microwave mode
- **E15** or **E** = Temperature error – removable "C"

## Motivation

Miele refused to supply the required spare parts, offering only a replacement microwave instead. <br>
The original keypad is known to fail, but with this guide, you might be able to repair your microwave and reduce electronic waste! <br>
